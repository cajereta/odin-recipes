    <h1> Belle's Hamburger Buns</h1>
    <h2>My mom used to make these hamburger buns all the time. They are so easy to make: light and fluffy as well as beautiful to look at. I get raves whenever I make them. Try using them for sandwich rolls too--delicious!</h2>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><h4>1 cup milk  </h4></li>
      <li><h4>1 cup water  </h4></li>
      <li><h4>2 tablespoons butter  </h4></li>
      <li><h4>1 tablespoon white sugar  </h4></li>
      <li><h4>5Â½ cups all-purpose flour </h4></li>
      <li><h4>1(.25 ounce) envelope active dry yeast </h4></li>
      <li><h4>1 egg yolk </h4></li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h3>Step 1</h3>
    <h4>Combine the milk, 1 cup of water, butter, sugar and salt in a saucepan. Bring to a boil then remove from the heat and let stand until lukewarm. If the mixture is too hot, it will kill the yeast.</h4>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h3>Step 2</h3>
    <h4>In a large bowl, stir together the flour and yeast. Pour in wet ingredients and stir until the dough starts to pull together. If you have a stand mixer, use the dough hook to mix for about 8 minutes. If not, knead the dough on a floured surface for about 10 minutes. Place the dough in a greased bowl, turning to coat. Cover and let stand until doubled in size, about 1 hour. </h4>
    <h3> Step 3</h3>
    <h4>Punch down the dough and divide into 12 portions They should be a little larger than a golf ball. Make tight balls out of the dough by pulling the dough tightly around and pinching it at the bottom. Place on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper or aluminum foil. After the rolls sit for a minute and relax, flatten each ball with the palm of your hand until it is 3 to 4 inches wide. You may want to oil your hand first. Set rolls aside until they double in size, about 20 minutes.</h4>

    <h3> Step 4</h3>
    <h4>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Mix together the egg yolk and 1 tablespoon of water in a cup or small bowl. Brush onto the tops of the rolls. Position 2 oven racks so they are not too close to the top or bottom of the oven.</h4>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h3>Step 5</h3>
    <h4>Bake for 10 minutes in the preheated oven. Remove the rolls from the oven and return them to different shelves so each one spends a little time on the top. Continue to bake for another 5 to 10 minutes, or until nicely browned on the top and bottom.</h4>
